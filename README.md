## Things I learned 🔥

This project made a huge diference on how I think my personal projects, majorly because it was kinda hard to plan how things would work.
I learned how to use Navigation in React Native, because you can't use links like in a plain HTML file.
When refactoring the whole project, I had to rethink the model I was using to fetch all the data. I stored all the app data in one big array, and if the app growed larger I knew this
would be a performance issue. So I made two arrays that connected bythe same Id, and I think this made a pretty big difference on the project.
I implemented two contexts also, that was kinda tricky because every component needed some information, so I had to think very accuratelly to make it work.

In the end, with lots of energy and thinking to solve every issue, everything worked, and honestly I had lots of fun making Shopit. 💯💯

> Note: Mobile is the actual app. Web is its website folder.
